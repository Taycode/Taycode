- ðŸŒ± **What I'm Learning:** Currently diving into ReactJS and eyeing a future in Data Engineering.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Collaboration Interests:** Always excited to collaborate on projects involving Django, NestJS, Python, and TypeScript. Letâ€™s solve real-world problems with real-world data!
- ðŸ¤” **Side Projects:** Building a job-matching platform called Haya, and working on a news sentiment analysis project. In the long run, I dream of bridging data engineering and football.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask Me About:** Backend development, automation, and anything Python/Django or NestJS-related.
- âš½ **Fun Fact:** Huge fan of football and random facts.
- ðŸ’­ **My Dreams:** One day, I hope to bring data engineering to the football world in Nigeriaâ€”or maybe even own a broadcasting company!
